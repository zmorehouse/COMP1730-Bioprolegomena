# Bioprolegomena
Bioprolegomena is a university assignment focused on analysing nucleotide sequences, using some additional python libraries such as NumPy and MatPlotLib.

The script takes two Nucleotide sequences as inputs (as seen within the test cases), and calculates/returns a number of values. These include :
- The edit distance of the two sequences (best possible sequence alignment utilising a penalty system)
- The probability of one string mutating to the other.
- The nMax (highest probability under specific conditions).
- A line graph showing the different probability values, and highlighting the nmax.
